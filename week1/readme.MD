# Simple CLI Projects: Calculator and Temperature Converter

This repository contains basic C++ console applications to practice fundamental programming concepts. It is designed with modular structure to support individual features in separate files.

## Features

### 1. Calculator
A simple arithmetic calculator that supports:

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Division by zero detection
- Loop with repeat option
- Organized using functions for each operation
- Proper user interaction and error handling

### 2. Temperature Converter
A console-based temperature conversion tool.

#### Main Features:
- Input a temperature value and its unit (`C`, `F`, or `K`)
- Automatically convert to all other temperature units
- Error handling for invalid units

#### Bonus Features:
- Table generator: convert a range of temperatures (0 to 100) in steps of 10 and display all results
- Looping for multiple conversions in one run
- Modular structure with function separation

## Future Plan
- Merge calculator and temperature converter into a single CLI tool
- Add a menu-based interface to choose between tools
- Possibly expand to other unit converters (e.g., length, weight)
